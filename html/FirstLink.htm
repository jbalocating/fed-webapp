	<h4>Expertise in the field of dyeing</h4>
	LACOSTE possesses considerable expertise in dyeing with nearly 2,000 tonnes of material dyed every year at its workshop in Troyes.
	<br>
	<br>
	This expertise has led Lacoste to elaborate strict specifications regarding chemical substances, based on respect of the tightest regulations in the world.
	The Lacoste dyeing plant is also a centre for research and development at the service of ecological innovation.
