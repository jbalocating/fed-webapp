	<h4>Chamaille, The Story of a Thread</h4>
	In 2013, faithful to its values of innovation, Lacoste launched CHAMAILLE. Chamaille is a three-year industrial research project dedicated to the creation of an ecological-based thread of French origin to be used in the manufacture of woven hemp products. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Because of its innovative character, the project is supported by ADEME (the French Agency for Environment and Energy Management).
